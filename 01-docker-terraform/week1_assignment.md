## Module 1 Homework Solution

## Docker & SQL

## Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker 

```docker --help```

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

```docker build --help```

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* 

- `--delete`
- `--rc`
- `--rmc`
- `--rm`

### Answer
- `--rm`


## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). 

What is version of the package *wheel* ?

- 0.42.0
- 1.0.0
- 23.0.1
- 58.1.0

### Answer
```bash
docker build -t test:pandas .

docker run -it test:pandas

- 0.42.0```


## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15767
- 15612
- 15859
- 89009

### Answer

```bash
SELECT
  CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
  COUNT(1) AS "count"
FROM
  green_taxi_trips t
GROUP BY
  CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" DESC;

- 15767
```

## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-09-18
- 2019-09-16
- 2019-09-26
- 2019-09-21

### Answer
```bash
SELECT
  CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
  COUNT(1) AS "count",
  MAX(trip_distance) as max_trip,
  MAX(passenger_count)
FROM
  green_taxi_trips t
GROUP BY
  CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY max_trip DESC;

- 2019-09-26
```


## Question 7. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.
```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "demo__assignment_dataset"

    }

      + force_destroy               = true

      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + terraform_labels            = (known after apply)
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "Delete"
            }
          + condition {
              + age                   = 30
              + matches_prefix        = []
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + matches_suffix        = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + versioning {
          + enabled = true
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
